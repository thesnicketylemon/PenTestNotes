# Java/.NET Deserialisation

## Brief
**Deserialization** takes data structured from some format (JSON, XML etc) and reuilds  it into an object. The features of deserialization mechanisms can be repurposed for malicious effect when operating on untrusted data.

The requirements for a Deserialisation attack are:
1. The library invokes methods on user-controlled types like non-default constructors, setters, deserialization callbacks, destructors, etc.  
2. The availability of a large gadget space to find code whose logic can be abused by the attacker to craft payloads.
