### TLS Record Protocol
The Record Protocol takes messages to be transmitted, fragments the data into manageable blocks, optionally compresses the data, applies a MAC, encrypts, and transmits the result.

Received data is decrypted, verified, decompressed, reassembled, and then delivered to higher-level clients.

There are four protocols that use the Record Protocol. They are differentiated by a record
1. Handshake Protocol
2. Alert Protocol
3. Change Cipher Spec Protocol
4. Application Data Protocol

 Implementations MUST NOT send record types not defined unless negotiated by some extension. So if a TLS implementation receives an unexpected record type, it MUST send an `unexpected_message` alert.
