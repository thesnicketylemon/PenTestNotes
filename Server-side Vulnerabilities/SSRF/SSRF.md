## Server-side request forgery (SSRF) 

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) allows an attacker to make a server-side application to make HTTP Requests to an
arbitrary domain of the attacker's choosing e.g. the attacker makes the server connect to internal-only services in the
organization's infrastructure, connect to an arbitrary external and leak auth credentials.

### Access local server
Try bypassing access controls by going to `localhost/admin` or `127.0.0.1/admin`. Applications sometimes implicitly
trust requests coming from the local machine because of an assumption that only a trusted user would be able to 
access the server itself.
Alternate ways of IP representation:
1. Skip the zeros e.g. `127.0.0.1` try `127.1`. The zeroes are added BEFORE the last digit
2. Add a lot of zeros to the last digit e.g. `127.0.00000000000000000000000000000000001` for `127.0.0.1`
3. Overflow a digit e.g. `10.0.513` translates to `10.0.2.1` because `513` is represented as `2 * 256 + 1`
4. Decimal notation e.g. `2130706433` for `127.0.0.1`
5. Hexadecimal notation e.g. `0x7f000001` or `0x7f.0x0.0x0.0x1` for `127.0.0.1`
6. Octet notation e.g. `017700000001` or `0177.0.0.01` for `127.0.0.1`
7. Binary notation e.g. `01111111000000000000000000000001` for `127.0.0.1`
8. URL encoding e.g. `http://%31%32%37%2E%30%2E%30%2E%31` for `127.0.0.1`. Try double-URL-encoding the entire URL to 
see if it bypasses any checks.

### Blind SSRF
Blind SSRF can be induced to issue a back-end HTTP request, but the response is not returned to the application's front-end. To detect this, we have to use out-of-band techniques i.e. montor netowkr interactions of a server that you own.

### Detect SSRF
Many server-side request forgery vulnerabilities are relatively easy to spot, because the application's normal traffic involves request parameters containing full URLs.
1. APIs that contain parameters that allow URLs.
2. APIs that trigger an open redirection capability.
3. An application places only a hostname or part of a URL path into request parameter
4. The Referer header is used to visit a third-party URL to analyze the contents of referring sites, including the anchor text that is used in the incoming links. So the Referrer header is susceptible to SSRFs.
