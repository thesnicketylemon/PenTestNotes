## Access Control

Access control depends on authentication and session management:
1. Authentication identifies the user and confirms that they are who they are
2. Session management identifies what requests are behind made by the same user
3. Access control determines whether a user is allowed to perform the action that they are trying to perform

### Broken Access Control examples
1. A non-administrative user can perform administrative actions
2. A user can access another user's profile and perform actions of the another user.

### Identify Access Control
1. Check the `robots.txt` directory
2. Do a search in the source code for if-else statements to check if any pages are being hidden
3. Check for hidden fields, cookies or query string parameters that can let you assume a different role
4. Check whether you can modify other attributes in POST requests that change attributes of a user e.g. while changing 
the username of a user, can you escalate privileges also.
5. Old PHP or IISframeworks may support legacy headers like `X-Original-URL` or `X-Rewrite-URL`. These headers lets you override
the path in the request URL. This is useful when there are front-end controls that prevent access to some URLs, but no
back-end controls.
6. Try to use `PUT` or `GET` instead of `POST` to see if you can circumvent any HTTP verbs based access-control
7. Do some recon to see if user identifiers are exposed in different parts of the application e.g. in a message board,
can you get the id of a specific user and then do some horizontal access control
8. Check if there are pre-filled fields in a masked input, and see if you can get these pre-filled fields by sending a 
request as another user
9. Check if you can modify the `Referer` tag to come from a valid URL and see if you can perform some actions that you 
are not authorized to do
10. Check each URL in an elevated user's actions to see if there is one that doesn't have proper access control mechanisms.
