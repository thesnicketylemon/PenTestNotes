## OAuth 2.0 Authentication

OAuth enables websites and web applications to request limited access to a user's account on another application e.g. Logging into Yelp through Google. OAuth allows the user to grant  access without exposing their login credentials to the requesting application.

- **Client application** - The web application that wants to access the user's data.
- **Resource owner** - The user whose data the client application wants to access.
- **OAuth service provider** - The website that controls the user's data and its access. They support OAuth by providing an API for interacting with both an authorization server and a resource server.

There are two common OAuth grant types (OAuth flows). They are:
