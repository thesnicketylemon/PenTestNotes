To scan for ports, use `nmap -sV <ip-address>`

### Telnet
Runs by default on port `23`
Once successfully connected, try using common login names like `admin`, `administrator`, `root`

## File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
1. Do a search of common exploits based on the version number of FTP
2. Use `get` to copy any files to local machine.
3. Connect to the FTP server using `ftp <ip>`. Try anonymous login by doing username: `anonymous` and password is an email.
