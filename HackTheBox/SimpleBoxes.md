To scan for ports, use `nmap -sV <ip-address>`

### Telnet
Runs by default on port `23`
Once successfully connected, try using common login names like `admin`, `administrator`, `root`

# Fawn
## File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
1. Do a search of common exploits based on the version number of FTP
2. Use `get` to copy any files to local machine.
3. Connect to the FTP server using `ftp <ip>`. Try anonymous login by doing username: `anonymous` and password is an email.

## Server Message Block (SMB) 
This is the Samba server thing that runs in Windows.
To connect to a Samba server, use `smbclient \\\\<ip>\\<workspace> <username>`
The default password for `root` was `root`

To find the list of shares, do `smbclient -L <ip>`
